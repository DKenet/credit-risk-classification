# this is module 20 for the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. 


Overview: 
This challenge creates and trains a model based on loan risk taken from historical lending activity.

 

Healthy Loan:

 

 

• Precision: 1.00 which indicates a very precise rate of identifying healthy loans.

 

• Recall:0.99 means again that healthy loans were correctly identified.

 

High-Risk Loan:

 

• Precision:0.85 which is still a pretty high percentage of high-risk loans that were detected.

 

• Recall: 0.91 recall which is better than the precision factor and quite high overall.

 

• Accuracy: The accuracy of the model is extremely high due to its reliance with detecting healthy loans at a total of 91%

 

Recommendation: The company should definitely use this model moving forward. While high-risk loans may need to be more scrutinized

and pass by more safeguards, the ability to continuously predict healthy loans will allow the company to keep maintaining

more and more healthy loans.
